This is a repository for creating, editing, and updating adaptive cards that I use in my O365 Business Standard subscription for automation.


Adaptive Cards are little pieces of UI arranged in JSON to make creation and serving of UI elements to various applications easier to manage.  With a little creativity, you can create dynamic Adaptive Cards that can generate useful data for you and your organization.

In my use case, a home devops/hobby game studio, we'll be starting with some basic reminders for daily chores, chore creation cards, and so on.
